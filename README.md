# Genre-Classification-Using-Lyrics
# Developed a deep learning solution for music genre classification using song lyrics.
# Designed NLP preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, custom stopword removal for English and Hindi) to clean large datasets.
# Leveraged GloVe and FastText embeddings to convert lyrics into dense semantic features.
# Built and fine-tuned CNN and LSTM models with TensorFlow/Keras using early stopping, LR reduction, and class weighting.
